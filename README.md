# Switch Roulette


## Overview
This project features a two-player game that is similar to the world-famous Russian Roulette, but with NEXYS A7 switches instead of gunshots. When the button to start the game is pressed, 1 of the 16 switches on the NEXYS A7 Board, at random, will trigger a bomb when flipped! The other 15 are deemed "safe". Players take turns flipping one switch at a time, and the player who flips the bomb switch loses. Good luck!
